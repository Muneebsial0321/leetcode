# ⚙️ LeetRust: DSA & LeetCode in Rust 🦀💡

Welcome to my personal grind repo where I solve **LeetCode problems** and explore **Data Structures & Algorithms** — all written in blazing-fast ⚡ and memory-safe 🦀 **Rust**.

## 📦 What's inside?

- 🧠 Classic DSA problems (arrays, strings, trees, graphs, you name it)
- 🔐 LeetCode-style problem organization
- 🧪 Clean, testable, modular Rust code
- 🧰 Growing toolkit of patterns, tricks & idioms in Rust

## 🚀 Why Rust?

Because:
- It's **fast**.
- It's **safe**.
- And it makes DSA feel like boss battles. 💥

## 🗂️ Structure

- `src/`
  - `_two_sum.rs` — LeetCode #1: Two Sum  
  - `main.rs` — Entry point for quick testing


- Each problem lives in its own module under `src/_<number>_<probilem_name>/`.
- Organized by LeetCode ID for sanity ✅.

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
cargo run
```
Or test a specific module by editing main.rs.

## 📈 Goals
- Sharpen algorithmic thinking 💭

- Master Rust through real-world practice 🦾

- Build a personal reference library of DSA patterns 📚

⚡ Tip: Want to try Rust for LeetCode? This is a solid launchpad. Fork it, break it, rebuild it.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress 
- Basic problems DP & Graphs
- CI / Test runner  
- Problem auto-loader 🔄
